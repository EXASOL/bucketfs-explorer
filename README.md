# bucketfs-explorer

The BucketFS explorer is a tiny GUI written in Java/JavaFX that helps you working with BucketFS.

###### Please note that this is an open source project which is *not yet officially supported* by EXASOL. We will try to help you as much as possible, but can't guarantee anything since this is not an official EXASOL product.

##Prerequisites

* Java 1.8 BucketFS Explorer was tested with Java 8u144.
* You need to have credentials for EXAoperation, because a lot of the functionality requires [XMLRPC](https://github.com/EXASOL/exaoperation-xmlrpc)
